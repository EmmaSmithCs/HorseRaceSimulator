# HorseRaceSimulator
A horse race simulator for my OOP project.

## Features
Running races
Adding horses
Adding tracks
Customization
Viewing previous stats of horses and races

## Using Part 1
Part 1 is very simple. The Main class holds the main method to initiate the program. Run the Main class, and nothing else needs to be touched. A race will start immediately by calling the startRace() method.

## Using Part 2
Part 2 is more complex. The Race class now holds the main method, which starts up the GUI. Once the GUI is started, there are many functions the user can use. They should first add a track or choose one from the tracks menu. Then the horses need to be added to the lanes from the chosen track. By pressing the start race button on the home page, a race will start. The user should only wait a little bit for the result to come through.

## Credits
The graphical version of the simulator uses the Swing framework for GUI components.
